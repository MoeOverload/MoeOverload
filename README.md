<h1>👋 Hi, I’m @MoeOverload</h1>

My journey began with a decision to build a video game, leading me to take Harvard's CS50 online course to deepen my knowledge in programming.
I’ve since expanded my expertise by assembling and managing a personal home server from repurposed computer parts, which has enriched my understanding of technology.
I’m excited to leverage my technical skills and hands-on experience in a dynamic tech role where I can continue to learn and grow.
Currently im working with GDscript and Godot.

<h3>- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other beginners who are also starting out</h3>

<h3>- ⚡ Fun fact:</h3>
the front pannel of my home server is a pizza box... i got 2 pc's for the price of one so it only seemed fit to give it the name pizza box pc
and strap an authentic *used* "2 for 1" pizza box as the front pannel.
